      <p id = "expansion" class = 'sta-p'>Welcome to the first ever Armstrong Ice Cream Challenge!</p>
      <p id = "expansion" class = 'sta-p'>2020 was difficult for many local families and businesses. It’s our desire to create something fun and positive to encourage people to get out and support our local businesses throughout Armstrong County. What better way to do that than to make a family trip out for ice cream?!</p>
      <a href="#expansion"><button class = 'expand-button'>Click to Read More!</button></a>
      
    </div>
    <div  class = 'expand-page expansion'>
        <p class = 'expansion-p'>We are looking to have some fun and promote local business as we enter into what will hopefully be a very busy summer season. We want 2021 to the best year ever for local business, so we are hosting the first ever Armstrong Ice Cream Challenge.
        </p>
        <p class = 'expansion-p'>Here’s what it will look like:
        </p>
        <p class = 'expansion-p'>Each week, we’ll visit a different local ice cream place and try 3 different ice cream creations. After we’ve visited all of the shops, we’ll give awards for the best ice cream in each category. We’ll then reveal the people's choice for their favorite ice cream shop and give away gift cards from each participating shop. We'll also have grand prize winner who will get a $10 gift card to every shop in the challenge so they can have their very own Armstrong Ice Cream Tour!
        </p>
        <p class = 'expansion-head'>Here are the 3 Categories for the competition:</p>
        <p class = 'expansion-p'><b>The Classic</b> – Give us your best classic ice cream flavor. Simple and clean. We’re highlighting the quality of the product in this category.
        </p>
        <p class = 'expansion-p'><b>The Crowd Favorite</b> – What is each shop's most popular flavor or topping? Is it shakes, sundaes, or something else? We want to know what people who visit the most love the best. 
        </p>
        <p class = 'expansion-p'><b>The Craziest Creation</b> – Show us the wildest thing on the menu. The showstopper. It could be something huge or something unique, or maybe a little bit of both. It might be something already on the menu or something created just for this competition. We want to give people a reason to travel across the County to get a taste of their own. 
        </p>

        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  Week 1 of the Armstrong Ice Cream Challenge is in the books! The first ice cream shop we tried was Speedy’s Tasty Treats in Ford City, PA. They certainly set the bar high with their ice cream creations! </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  Speedy’s has over 10,000 followers on Facebook, which is extremely impressive in a town of 3,500 people. With that kind of following, they must be doing something right and we were certainly not disappointed. </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  At each shop we travel to, we ask to try three ice cream treats: The Classic, The Crowd Favorite, and The Craziest Creation. For more details on the categories, check out this intro video: <a class = 'blog-links' target = '_blank' href="https://youtu.be/ZQ2LE8x9AyA">https://youtu.be/ZQ2LE8x9AyA</a> </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  These were their entries for the challenge: </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  The Classic – Speedy’s makes 1,000 chocolate chip cookies each week to make 500 of their famous chipper sandwiches. These local staples are loved by just about everyone who tries them. Frozen cookies sometimes get a weird texture, but theirs tasted fresh and the frozen soft serve in the middle makes for a great classic treat. The kids (and the adults) loved them.</p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  The Crowd Favorite – We couldn’t decide between their two options, so we went ahead and tried them both. (You’re welcome! 😊) The first was a Turtle Sundae. With layers of soft serve, pecans, hot fudge, and hot caramel, this was a really rich treat. I personally love caramel, so this was right up my alley. The caramel was some of the smoothest and richest that I’ve ever tasted. Not to be outdone, we had our first creation that contained no chocolate: The Strawberry Shortcake Sundae. This creation started with a piece of white cake soaked in strawberry juice and covered in vanilla soft serve, more strawberries and whip cream. The homemade cake was light and fresh and was a great contrast to the Turtle Sundae. They really seem to have something for everyone at Speedy’s. </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  The Craziest Creation – I had never heard of a banana split shake before today. Some time ago, they had a customer ask for all the things in a banana split blended together and the Banana Split Shake was born. By the time they made it, it weighed in at 32 ounces! I wasn’t sure about having all of those flavors together in one drink, but this creation really surprised me with how good it was. The flavors hit you one by one with every gulp. Banana, pineapple, strawberry, peanut, and finally chocolate. It was super unique and still worked well. If you’ve got the space for 32 ounces, give it a try!  </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  Overall, we can see why Speedy’s is so well loved by Ford City and the surrounding area. It’s a wonderful option anytime you’re passing by and would definitely be worth the drive from anywhere in Armstrong County. Make plans to visit them soon and don’t forget to follow them on Facebook to check out their weekly flavors and specials.  </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  If you vote for Speedy’s as your favorite ice cream place, you’ll be entered to win the $25 gift card to their shop. Make sure to fill out the quick form   <a class = 'blog-links' href="https://mailchi.mp/b47f5df85694/armstrong-ice-cream-challenge" target = "_blank">HERE</a> to be entered for the giveaway at the end of June! 8 lucky winners will receive a gift card for their favorite shop, and one lucky winner will receive $10 to all 8 shops so they can create their very own Armstrong Ice Cream Tour. Good luck!  </p>
        <p class = 'blog-body-text'>  The next video comes out on Sunday, May 16th, at 7PM, so check back next week as we continue the Armstrong Ice Cream Challenge! </p>
